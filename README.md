# ✌🏼 Hi, I'm *Layla*.
## `I am a self-taught software developer`
> I am also a mom, registered dietitian nutritionist, adjunct instructor, and avid community volunteer. You can find me at many local tech meetups in OKC! Check out my [portfolio](https://laylakrauss.dev) to learn more.  

👩‍👦‍👦 Full-time `mom` by day, `full-stack developer` by night<br>
🧩 I thrive off learning database architecture and solving the puzzle of getting data from point A to point B, manipulating data, and debugging server-side errors<br>
🍇 `laravel` and `dotnet` have been my jam lately<br>
🐳 Experienced with `docker`; interested in learning more `ci/cd`<br>
🎨 Even though I am happiest in the backend, I still enjoy making responsive web applications using `vue`<br>
🐠 I love cooking and eating `salmon bowls`<br>
🌎 My [husband](https://github.com/alkrauss48) and sons are my entire world<br><br>
