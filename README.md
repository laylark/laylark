# ✌🏼 Hi, I'm *Layla*.
## `I am a self-taught software developer`
> I am also a mom, registered dietitian nutritionist, adjunct instructor, and avid community volunteer. You can find me at many local tech meetups in OKC! Check out my [portfolio](https://laylakrauss.dev) to learn more.  

👀 Looking for work as a `junior full-stack developer`<br>
🧩 I thrive off learning database architecture and solving the puzzel of getting data from point A to point B, manipulatng data, and debugging server-side errors<br>
🍇 `django` and `sql` have been my jam lately<br>
🐳 Some experience with `docker`; interested in learning more `ci/cd`<br>
🎨 Even though I am happiest in the backend, I still enjoy making responsive web applications<br><br>

**PROJECTS**<br>
🍼 [NICU Calculations](https://nicu.mothercodesbest.dev/) is a nutrition calculator I built using `flask` that I use daily at work. - Private repo, ask me about it.<br>
📝 [Tidbits](https://tidbits.mothercodesbest.dev/) is a fun `flask` app that I created after following the OpenAI API tutorial. Be prepared for some blunt, snarky responses.<br>
🐶 [Doggy Auctions](https://github.com/laylark/commerce) is an Ebay-like auction site built using `django` as a part of the CS50W coursework. **Disclaimer: this app was to help me better learn Django models and migrations. I do not condone auctioning off your pets!**<br><br>
