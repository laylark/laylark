# ‚úåüèº Hi there, I'm *Layla*.
## `You've found your way to my GitHub README. Enjoy!`
<br />
I‚Äôm a code newbie! I work as a neonatal registered dietitian and adjunct teaching undergrad and grad students. I got started by building myself a calculator to make my life easier at work (90% of my job is calculations). After working on the application for a few days, I wanted to learn more. And, well, here I am!
<br />
<br />
I‚Äôm having way too much fun and have started dreaming (literally) about coding. At this current moment I have no idea what my future holds, I just know this stuff is fun and I want to learn more and more! Maybe some freelance work one day? Who knows.
